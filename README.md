# Adverse-Event-Prediction-System-on-FAERS-Dataset
Developed a predictive model for identifying occurrence of adverse events using the FDAâ€™s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) dataset, achieving 82% accuracy with Random Forest Classifier. The FAERS dataset is a comprehensive collection of adverse event reports caused by drugs, compiled from multiple sources. The original dataset was structured across seven distinct tables: Demographic, Drugs, Indications, Outcome, Reaction, Report Source, and Therapy. These tables were merged using primary identifiers (PrimaryID and CaseID) to create a unified dataset for analysis. Dataset is available on the FDA website 
Preprocessing strategies like hierarchical missing value imputation, advanced feature engineering, TF-IDF vectorization for textual features, and statistical validation using Chi-Square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed . Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were trained. Random Forest Classifier achieved best performance giving an accuracy of 82 percent after hyperparameter tuning. Feature importance analysis further refined the predictive framework by identifying critical risk factors. This model offers significant potential for proactive safety monitoring and real-time risk assessment, paving the way for future research in identifying high-risk drug combinations and mitigating adverse medication outcomes.
